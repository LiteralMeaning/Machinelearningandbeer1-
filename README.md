Brewing using ai solutions (first attempt)
Beer wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer
Brainstorm: Using ai solutions to come up with recipes for brewing beer (possibly wine and spirits later for application)....5 articles I found after a google serach                 (links below) and what else?
            1,2,3 Find data, using the cloud---sometimes free resources to run existing ai models (AWS, Floydhub etc.)----tune models also find existing models online               and github, and come up with your own etc....and find solutions....I am brewing these beers for my own consumption :):):):):) Also later to use same 1,2,3 to 
            use ai for making food dishes, baking etc...links to follow.... YEAY, FUN FUN FUN BEER BEER BEER + Ai. :):):):):)
